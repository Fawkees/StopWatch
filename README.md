# How do I run this program?

To download and run the program, please head over to the releases page of this repository.

There may be some issues with anti viruses false detecting. You can see the full source code here on github and verify yourself that there isn't and malware or other stuff integrated in the program.
If you still don't trust me, you can also compile the program yourself.

# Is this program allowed by Riot Games?

Well this question is good but it about the same as to ask if it's allowed to use discord while playing. StopWatch doesnt interact with the game in any way so there is nothing they can do about it. A similar question got asked on reddit. You can [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4c78hh/i_wrote_a_legal_program_to_track_summoner_spells/d1g2dcu/) to see the comment by Riot Sargonas.
Since StopWatch doesnt interact with any gamefiles it should therefor not break any other rules.

Basically, it's the same as running an app on your phone for tracking cooldowns. You don't modify game files and you still have to start the timers manually.
